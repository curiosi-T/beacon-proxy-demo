# Sample Hardhat Project
Code taken from [How to create a Beacon Proxy](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-create-a-beacon-proxy-3d55335f7353).

This project demonstrates how to use OpenZeppelin's upgrades plugin to deploy a Beacon proxy. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/beacon.ts
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat compile
```
